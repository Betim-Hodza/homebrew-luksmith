## Install

```sh
brew install --cask betim-hodza/luksmith/luksmith
```

That three-part name is Homebrew's normal format for a cask in a third-party
tap. It taps this repository automatically and installs the `luksmith` cask.

If you prefer to add the tap once, use the shorter command afterwards:

```sh
brew tap betim-hodza/luksmith
brew install --cask luksmith
```

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Mac | Apple silicon |
| macOS | 26 or later |
| Homebrew | Current stable release |

## What Homebrew installs

- The current notarized Developer ID `.pkg` from the [public Luksmith releases](https://github.com/Betim-Hodza/luksmith-releases/releases)
- Native LUKS1 and LUKS2 support
- Native ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystem support through macOS FSKit
- The SHA-256-pinned release asset defined in [`Casks/luksmith.rb`](Casks/luksmith.rb)

The app does not make outbound network connections. Homebrew only downloads the
installer when you install or upgrade it.

## Upgrade or remove

```sh
brew upgrade --cask luksmac
brew uninstall --cask luksmac
```
